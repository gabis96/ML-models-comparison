    "- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): mean of the absolute value of the errors: 1nâˆ‘i=1n|yiâˆ’y^i|. It is the easiest to understand, because it's the average error.\n",
    "- Mean Squared Error (MSE): mean of the squared errors: 1nâˆ‘i=1n(yiâˆ’y^i)^2. It is more popular than MAE, because MSE \"punishes\" larger errors, which tends to be useful in the real world.\n",
    "- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): square root of the mean of the squared errors: 1nâˆ‘i=1n(yiâˆ’y^i)^2. RMSE is even more popular than MSE, because RMSE is interpretable in the \"y\" units.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the previous are loss functions, because we want to minimize them.\n",
    "\n",
    "- accuracy: calculates the closseness of preditions to real values by residuals. The higher the accuracy the better. \n",
    "- r2_score: means how good a regression model fitted the data (regression score function). Best possible score is 1.0. = accuracy\n",
    "- Cross Validation: devides the data into k-folds, selecting one as the test data and the rest as training, iterating for each fold. How to interpret "
