EDA & Regression Models on World Happiness
==============================

This project curates and unifies all World Happiness datasets, including the last one available from 2022. An extensive data cleaning process is done, and afterwards exploratory analysis is used to find insights from the data. Regression is used to tackle missing values imputation and build predictive models, these are evaluated and compared. 

This repository extends the current work available online and aims to predict World Happiness for 2023. 

The results of this study will be published on my personal
[blog](https://gabrielarscp.wixsite.com/gabsdatascience/blog).

## Roadmap

- Collect World Happiness datasets from the last years.
- Curate old datasets and homogenize fields to unify all sources in one.
- Check for faulsy values.
- Impute missing values.
    - Try out various regression techniques.
    - Compare techniques looking at distributions or doing cross validation.
    - Apply the best one.
- Do exploratory data analysis and examine:
    - Correlation between variables (Identify highest correlated variables).
    - Category with higher impact in the Happiness Score.
    - Distribution of Happiness Score.
    - Top/bottom 10 countries in the podium for the last 8 years.
    - Top/bottom 10%til countries in happiness.
    - Overall best performing country in each category by average.
    - Evaluate regions performance in each category by average.
- Comparison between regression models.
- Build predictive models using regression.
    - Compare results evaluating with appropiate metrics. 
    - Models tuning.
- Do predictive extrapolation using time series on the data and analyze (Future Work):
    - Rank in 2023
    - Which country is on itâ€™s way to becoming the first Utopia? (>9.0) 
    - Which country is on itâ€™s way to becoming the first Dystopia? (<1.0)
- Create infographic.

## Datasets
### World Happiness
The World Happiness Report is a landmark survey of the state of global happiness that ranks 156 countries by how happy their citizens perceive themselves to be. 

Unfortunately, my home country Cuba is not in the countries analized. 

*Name*: World Happiness Report

*Source*: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathurinache/world-happiness-report

*Institution*: Gallup World Survey

*Date*: 2022-03 

#### Factors that explain the Happiness Score
The Happiness Score is explained by the following factors: GDP per capita, Healthy Life Expectancy, Social support, Freedom to make life choices, Generosity, Corruption Perception, Residual error

### Geolocation
*Name*: Countries geolocation data

*Source*: https://gadm.org/download_country.html

*Date*: 2023-01 

## Results
- Data Wrangling Stage:
    - Unified source for all years - World Happiness index datasets.
    - Includes happiness score, rank, year, country, region, and features that explain happiness.
- EDA Insights:
    - Happiness Score is highly correlated to GDP, social support and healthy life expectancy. 
    - Most countries are happy.
    - Happines tends to grow each year very slowly.
    - The happiest regions in order are: Australia and New Zealand, North America and Western Europe.
    - The unhappiest regions are Southern Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa.
    - The happiest countries are Finland, Denmark, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland.
    - The unhappiest countries are Rwanda, Tanzania, Afghanistan.
- Regression models:
    - Linear Regression shows better performance for the data.
    - Regression Forest would be second place.

## Future Work
- EDA: 
    - Examine if population size and Happiness Score are correlated.
    - Identify if there is causal effect between Happiness Score and Wealth/Health.
- Time series Prediction
