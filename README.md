Regression Models on World Happiness
==============================

This project uses regression to tackle various problems and interesting analysis in the World Happiness dataset, extending the current available work online. Several regression models arre apply, evaluated and compare. 
The results of this study will be published on my personal
[blog](https://gabrielarscp.wixsite.com/gabsdatascience/blog).

## Roadmap

- Use cookiecutter-data-science template. 
- Define ML problems that will be tackle (Regression, Classification, Clustering, Association).
- Tackle one ML approach at a time.
- Collect different dataset with the necessary characteristics.  
- Define methods to study and then analyze datasets.
- Compare results evaluating with appropiate metrics. 

## Python Stack

**Math & Machine Learning:** sklearn, numpy, scipy
**Data Manipulation:** pandas
**Visualization:** mathplotlib, plotly
